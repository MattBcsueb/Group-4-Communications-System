# Group-4-Communication-Network  
Client requests a text-based chat system for their company employees to communicate.  
# Features
#### Required
* All employees are assigned a username, and must supply a password  
* One-on-one chat  
* Group chat  
* Strictly text-based, no images/voice/video  
* Centralized message system through the company's server  
* Asynchronous messaging  
* All chats are to be recorded  
#### Optional 
* Profile Pictures  
* Broadcasting  
# Planning
Further inquire client to narrow down the scope of the problem and clarify requirements.  

### Questions to ask:  
* Who should be allowed to view the recorded messages?  
* Should there be a notification system if messages were not successfully sent/received?  
* Should all chat rooms be strictly public (anyone can join)?  
* Should profanity be censored?  
* Should people be able to be kicked out of a chat room?  
* Are employees only communicating locally or countrywide?
